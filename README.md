[![Test Status](https://github.com/CyVerse-Ansible/ansible-irods-cfg/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CyVerse-Ansible/ansible-irods-cfg/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This role will eventually be able to be used to completely configure an iRODS server once iRODS is 
installed. At the moment, it can maintain the following configuration files.

* irods_environment.json
* etc/irods/host_access_control_config.json
* etc/irods/hosts_config.json
* etc/irods/server_config.json
* etc/irods/service_account.config
* var/lib/irods/.odbc.ini

## Requirements

iRODS 4.2.8 is installed.

## Tasks Files

The `main.yml` tasks file that is called by default performs the same tasks as `server.yml`, i.e., 
it deploys the set of files required by an iRODS server.

There are two tier-specific tasks files. `client.yml` deploys the configuration files required by a 
client, e.g., the iCommands. Currently, it deploys the irods_environment.json file. `server.yml` 
deploys the configuration files required by an iRODS server.

For each iRODS configuration file there is a corresponding tasks file that deploys only that 
configuration file. `irods_environment.yml` deploys the client or clerver configuration file, 
_irods_environment.json_ by default. In the `etc/irods/` directory, `host_access_control_config.yml` 
deploys host_access_control_config.json, `hosts_config.yml` deploys hosts_config.json, 
`server_config.yml` deploys server_config.json, and `service_account.yml` deploys 
service_account.config. In the `var/lib/irods` directory, `odbc.yml` deploys .odbc.ini.

The `init_zone_user.yml` tasks file is not part of `main.yml` or either of the tier-specific tasks 
files. It initializes the iRODS zone user on the inventory host.

## Role Variables

Here are the role variables. None of them are required.
